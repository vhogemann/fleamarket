# FLEA MARKET

This is a small _proof_ _of_ _concept_ project that uses [SpringData](http://www.springsource.org/spring-data) to acess a [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) persistence. It has complex relationships between domain classes, and a few validation rules to make things more like the real deal.

The Web project is kinda wonky, because I'm using Struts2 with Groovy.
